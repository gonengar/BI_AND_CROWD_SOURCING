This directory was named a in order to be loaded first of all other folders.
That's because components folder contain our components and those components need to be created on a module.

As those components are inside folders - they will be loaded first because of meteor's way of loading files and therefore -
those files can't be loaded as the "socially" module hasn't been loaded yet and therefore they reside on another module.
